title: "Unsubscribe Contacts"
---

Your contacts must be able to unsubscribe/opt out of receiving emails from you. Open enables this in two ways:

- An API for generating links that your contacts can click to unsubscribe
- An API for unsubscribing contacts from within your apps

## Unsubscribe Link

You can call [this endpoint](./unsubscribe_url_api) to generate a link that you can put in the body of any email, or anywhere in your application. You can generate this link using the contact's email, or their contact ID.

## Unsubscribe via API call from your apps

In case you want your contacts to unsubscribe in a way other than clicking a link and being redirected to Open, you can directly call [this endpoint](./unsubscribe_directly_api) to mark a contact as unsubscribed from all email.
