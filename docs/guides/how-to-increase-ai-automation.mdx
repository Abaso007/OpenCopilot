By now, you've probably noticed that AI handles many of your customer issues effectively. This success often comes from your deep understanding of the business and the quality of the training data provided. However, there are instances where the AI struggles, and in those moments, it's important to enhance your AI automation.

That's why we developed our reporting featureâ€”to give you insight into how your AI automation is performing. With built-in gamification, you can easily see where your AI excels and where it falls short, allowing you to make improvements.

**When the AI underperforms, it's usually due to a few key reasons**:

- Insufficient training data for the specific area
- Missing actions necessary to resolve the issue
- A lack of understanding of the business domain.



## Understanding the Report

When you open the reports page, you'll see a quick summary of your AI automation performance.

- You'll see a brief overview of each issue and the reason the AI was unable to solve it.
- To improve, consider adding more training data, defining new actions, or using the custom training feature to enhance the AI.
