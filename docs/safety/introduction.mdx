We know that AI, in its current form, is still new to the market. We’re constantly working to make sure it’s safe and reliable. That’s why we’ve implemented several measures to ensure the trustworthiness of our AI, giving you confidence when using it.

## Observability & Interpretability

These features are designed to give human agents the ability to see and understand the AI while it’s at work.

## Assist Mode (formerly Draft Mode)

For heavily regulated industries, we’ve introduced Assist Mode. This feature allows human agents to review the AI’s plan before sending it to the customer. Think of it as a human supervision layer for AI.
