## What's This?

By default, our AI will attempt to handle all customer inquiries. However, you can define specific topics that should always be handled by human agents instead.

<Note>
The AI will handle everything unless you specifically tell it not to. Configure restricted topics in your dashboard under: **Settings → Autopilot and Allowed Topics**
</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Default Behavior">
    AI handles all topics unless specifically restricted
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Smart Topic Detection">
    Our AI intelligently understands context and intent - no need to set specific keywords. It recognizes when a conversation relates to your restricted topics.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Notice">
    Customer is informed they'll be speaking with a human agent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Preservation">
    Full conversation history is provided to the human agent
  </Step>
</Steps>
