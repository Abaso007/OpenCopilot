## Setting up

You can self-host OpenCopilot in a relatively easy way, please make sure you have the following requirements:

- Docker engine and docker compose installed
- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openchatai/opencopilot.git
```

- Update your llm-server/.env with your OPENAI_API_KEY

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE
```

- Run the installation script

```bash
make install
```
Then your OpenCopilot dashboard will be accessible at https://api.opencopilot.so

You also can see the complete list of commands using `make help`
```
âžœ  OpenCopilot git:(main) make help
Usage: make [target]

Available Targets:

  install            - Install and set up the Docker environment
  db-setup           - Set up the database (fresh migration with seeding)
  down               - Stop and remove all containers
  exec-backend      - Access the backend container's shell
  exec-dashboard    - Access the dashboard container's shell
  exec-llm-server   - Access the llm-server container's shell
  restart            - Restart all containers
  logs               - Show container logs

  help               - Display this help message
```

## Crawling Web Pages

By default, when passing in a URL to create a new DataSource for a Copilot, 15 pages will be indexed. The configuration for this is located in the `opencopilot/llm-server/utils/llm_consts.py` file:

```python
max_pages_to_crawl = int(os.getenv("MAX_PAGES_TO_CRAWL", "15"))
```

To increase the max pages to crawl, you can change the configuration file. However, this will create uncommitted changes in your working copy which you will need to stash in order to `git pull` for future updates. Another way to increase the max pages to crawl is to set an environment variable:

```bash
export MAX_PAGES_TO_CRAWL="50"
```
