The **Guaranteed Delivery** feature in Open.cx ensures that messages from agents always reach the customer, no matter what communication channel the customer used or whether they are still online.

## How It Works

- If a customer sends a message through the chat widget but goes offline, Open.cx will automatically send your agent’s reply to the customer’s inbox.
- If the initial conversation was over the phone, agents can follow up through **SMS** and **email** simultaneously to ensure the message gets through.

This feature acts as a fallback, ensuring that no reply is lost, regardless of how the customer initially reached out. All communication channels are unified in the omnichannel inbox, so agents can continue the conversation seamlessly.

## Steps to Use Guaranteed Delivery

1. **Reply Normally** – Just send your reply through Open.cx like any other conversation.
2. **Fallback Happens Automatically** – If the customer is no longer reachable via the original channel (e.g., they went offline in chat), Open.cx will automatically send the message to their inbox or follow up via SMS and email.

## Unified Inbox

All conversations are tracked and unified in the omnichannel inbox, whether they began on chat, phone, or email. This means agents don’t have to switch between different systems—everything stays in one place.

## Key Points

- **Message Persistence**: Messages are delivered even if the customer is no longer reachable through the original channel.
- **Fallback Channels**: If needed, agents can follow up through multiple channels (email, SMS) at the same time.
- **Simplified Workflow**: All messages are unified, allowing agents to handle communication without worrying about the channel used.
