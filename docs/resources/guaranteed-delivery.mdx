## What's This?

Our Guaranteed Delivery system makes sure your messages always reach customers - even if they've gone offline or switched devices.

<Note>
Think of it as a smart postal service that always finds the best way to deliver your message!

## How It Works

  <Card title="Smart Fallback" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    If one channel fails, we automatically try others:
    - Chat → Email
    - Phone → SMS + Email
    - Always finds a way through
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Unified Tracking" icon="inbox">
    All conversations stay in one place:
    - Track every message
    - See delivery status
    - Monitor responses
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Scenarios
