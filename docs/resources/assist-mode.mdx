## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Creates Response">
    When an email arrives, AI drafts a response based on:
    - Customer's question
    - Your knowledge base
    - Previous interactions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team Reviews">
    Your team can:
    - Read AI's suggested response
    - See AI's reasoning and plan
    - Make any needed edits
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Choose to:
    - Send the response as-is
    - Edit then send
    - Write a completely new response
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI Response Plan

The AI shows you its thinking process:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "1. Check account status",
    "2. Identify issue cause",
    "3. Provide solution steps",
    "4. Add helpful resources"
  ]
}
```
