## useUpvote

### Purpose
The `useUpvote` hook is used to send an upvote for a specific chat message.


### Usage
```typescript
const [upvoteState, upvote] = useUpvote(messageId, onSuccessCallback);
```

### Parameters
- `id` (string): The unique identifier of the chat message to be upvoted.
- `onSuccess` (optional function): A callback function to be executed after a successful upvote.


### Returns
An array containing:
1. `upvoteState`: An object representing the current state of the upvote operation (loading, error, value).
2. `upvote`: A function to trigger the upvote action.


### Implementation Details
- Sends a POST request to `/chat/vote/${id}` using the `axiosInstance` from the ChatProvider.
- Returns a message confirming the upvote action.


## useDownvote


### Usage
```typescript
const [downvoteState, downvote] = useDownvote(messageId, onSuccessCallback);
```


### Parameters
- `id` (string): The unique identifier of the chat message to be downvoted.
- `onSuccess` (optional function): A callback function to be executed after a successful downvote.

### Returns
An array containing:
1. `downvoteState`: An object representing the current state of the downvote operation (loading, error, value).
2. `downvote`: A function to trigger the downvote action.


### Implementation Details
- Uses `useAsyncFn` to manage the asynchronous DELETE request.
- Sends a DELETE request to `/chat/vote/${id}` using the `axiosInstance` from the ChatProvider.
- Returns a message confirming the downvote action.


## Common Features
Both hooks:
- Utilize the `useChat` hook to access the `axiosInstance` for making API requests.
- Leverage `useAsyncFn` for efficient handling of asynchronous operations, including loading states and error handling.
- Accept an optional `onSuccess` callback for custom actions after successful operations.
- Are memoized based on their dependencies (`axiosInstance`, `id`, and `onSuccess`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.


## Example Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';

function ChatMessage({ serverId }) {
  const [upvoteState, upvote] = useUpvote(serverId, () => console.log('Upvoted!'));
  const [downvoteState, downvote] = useDownvote(serverId, () => console.log('Downvoted!'));

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={upvote} disabled={upvoteState.loading}>
        {upvoteState.loading ? 'Upvoting...' : 'Upvote'}
      </button>
      <button onClick={downvote} disabled={downvoteState.loading}>
        {downvoteState.loading ? 'Downvoting...' : 'Downvote'}
      </button>
      {upvoteState.error && <p>Error upvoting: {upvoteState.error.message}</p>}
      {downvoteState.error && <p>Error downvoting: {downvoteState.error.message}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```


# useChat Hook

The `useChat` hook manages chat functionality, including sending and receiving messages, handling session management, and interacting with a socket connection.


## Usage

```typescript
const chatInterface = useChat({
  apiUrl,
  socketUrl,
  botToken,
  defaultHookSettings,
  onHandoff,
  onSessionDestroy
});
```



## Return Value

The `useChat` hook returns an object with the following properties and methods:

### Properties

1. `state` (object): The current state of the chat.
   - `lastUpdated` (number | null): Timestamp of the last update.
   - `messages` (Array<MessageType>): Array of chat messages.

2. `session` (ChatSession | null): The current chat session or null if no session exists.

3. `noMessages` (boolean): True if there are no messages in the chat.

4. `initialData` (object): Initial data for the chat, including FAQ, history, initial questions, and logo.

5. `info` (ReactNode | null): Information about the current state of the chat, often related to socket connection status.

6. `events` (TypedEventTarget): Event emitter for various chat events.

7. `hookState` (string): Current state of the hook ('loading', 'error', or 'idle').

8. `settings` (object): Current settings for the chat.
   - `persistSession` (boolean): Whether the session is being persisted.
   - `useSoundEffects` (boolean): Whether sound effects are enabled.

9. `axiosInstance` (AxiosInstance): Axios instance configured for making API calls.

### Methods

1. `recreateSession()`: Clears the current session and creates a new one.

2. `clearSession()`: Clears the current session and all messages.

3. `sendMessage(messageData: object)`: Sends a new message to the chat.
   - `messageData.content.text` (string): The text content of the message.
   - `messageData.headers` (optional object): Additional headers for the message.
   - `messageData.user` (optional object): User information.
   - `messageData.query_params` (optional object): Additional query parameters.

4. `setSettings(newSettings: object)`: Updates the chat settings.

## Functionality

- Manages the chat state, including messages and session information.
- Handles WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
- Provides methods for sending messages and managing the chat session.
- Offers event handling for various chat events (new messages, handoffs, etc.).
- Integrates with a backend API for data persistence and retrieval.
- Supports customizable settings for session persistence and sound effects.
- Handles initial data loading, including chat history and FAQ.
- Provides real-time status updates about the chat and socket connection.

This hook encapsulates the core functionality needed for implementing a chat interface, making it easier to integrate chat capabilities into a React application.
