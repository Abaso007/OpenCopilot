`conversation.handoff_to_human`

This event is triggered when a conversation is handed off to a human agent. Note that a handoff event can happen for multiple reasons; for example, a human agent might decide to take over the conversation, or the AI might decide to hand off the conversation to a human agent.

<Accordion title="Sample Payload">
```json
{
    event: "conversation.handoff_to_human";
    organization_id: string;

           };
        };
    };
}
```
</Accordion>

`conversation.third_party_agent_response`

When a third-party software agent responds to a previously handed-off conversation, Open will notify you. In some configurations, Open might also initiate the handoff to a third-party agent, such as Zendesk or Intercom. Even while the third-party agent handles the conversation, Open continues to monitor and send events to your webhooks.

<Accordion title="Sample Payload">
```json
{
    event: "conversation.third_party_agent_response";
    organization_id: string;
    data: {
        conversation_id: string | null | undefined;
        timestamp: string;
        customer_id: string | null | undefined;
        third_party_name: "zendesk" | "intercom";
        response: string;
    };
};
```
</Accordion>
