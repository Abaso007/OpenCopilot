### When is a chat considered missed?

A chat is considered missed when:

1. AI Autopilot OFF:
   - A user initiates a chat
   - No human agent responds within a set time frame
   - The chat is automatically closed as unresolved

2. AI Autopilot ON:
   - A user initiates a chat
   - The AI attempts to handle the query but fails to resolve it
   - No human agent intervenes to assist
   - The chat is automatically closed as unresolved

In both cases, the key factors are:
- The chat session is closed
- The issue remains unresolved
- There is no last message, indicating no successful interaction
