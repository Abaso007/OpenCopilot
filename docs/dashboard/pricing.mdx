## Pricing Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Our pricing is fair">
We strive to keep our pricing as fair as possible. We believe that SaaS pricing is often flawed, as you frequently pay for features you do not use or get value from, or you pay for the same software multiple times due to the pay-per-seat model.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="You get the full software">
Once you subscribe to Open, you will have access to the full software. Nothing will be locked behind a paywall, so you won't need to think twice about new features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Only one plan">
    We have only one plan: Usage is based on our "Pay as you get value" model, which is explained below.
  </Accordion>  
  <Accordion title="Pay as you get value">
    In addition to the $499 fixed fee, usage is based on the value you get from Open. Here is a list of features used to calculate usage:

## Summary of Our Pricing

We do not charge for the platform itself, but we do charge for the value delivered to our customers, which is every time the AI agent solves a support ticket from start to finish without a human agent.

## Pay as You Get Value

### 1. AI Resolutions

We get paid when the AI agent solves your customer's issue. There are two types of AI resolutions: light resolution and solid resolution.

| AI Resolution     | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light Resolution  | The AI agent solves your customer's problem without taking any action; by answering text-based questions on any channel. |
| Solid Resolution  | The AI takes action(s) to solve your customer's problem, such as calling your CRM or backend system to update, delete, or add records.       |

Any conversation not resolved by the AI agent will be automatically handed off to a human agent, and we will not get paid for that. However, the human agent can use our AI-rich workspace to solve the problem.

**Pricing per resolution type:**

- **Solid resolution:** 0.50 USD per resolution (That's $50 for every 100 resolutions)
- **Light resolution:** 0.010 USD per resolution (That's $10 for every 1,000 resolutions)

### 2. AI Phone Calls

- In addition to the resolution rate, we also get paid per AI phone call. The cost is **$0.07 per minute**.
- To be able to make calls using the AI, you need to buy a phone number from the dashboard, and it costs **$2.99/month**.

### 3. AI Outbound Calls and Emails

- The cost is **$0.07/minute** for calls.
- The cost is **$0.01/email**.

## How Resolutions Are Marked as Resolved

- Our AI agent will ask the customer if the conversation is resolved. If the customer says yes, the AI agent will mark the conversation as resolved. If the customer says no, the AI agent will mark the conversation as handoff and will automatically hand off the conversation to a human agent.
- If the customer does not provide an answer, the AI will wait for 1 day, if the no further help is requested, we will close the conversation and mark it as relsoved

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1: Direct Confirmation**
   - AI: "Is your issue resolved?"
   - Customer: "Yes, it is."
   - AI: Marks the conversation as resolved.

2. **Example 2: No Immediate Response**
   - AI: "Is your issue resolved?"
   - Customer does not respond.
   - AI waits for 1 days.
   - If no further help is requested, we will close the conversation and mark it as relsoved

3. **Example 3: Negative Response**
   - AI: "Is your issue resolved?"
   - Customer: "No, it isn't."
   - AI: Marks the conversation as unresolved and escalates to a human agent.

## What are in-progress tickets?

When a user leaves a chat, phone, or email conversation without confirming whether the AI agent resolved the issue, the ticket is marked as Undecided (still in progress).  If the customer does not request further help, we will close the conversation and mark it as relsoved.

## Comparison with Other Providers

Our pricing page is available [here](https://open.cx/pricing). You will find a full comparison with other SaaS providers. Here is a quick table that summarizes the differences:

| # of Human Agents | # of Tickets per Month | Zendesk Cost | Intercom Cost | Open Cost |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| 30                | 2000                   | $7800/month  | $6400/month   | $1500/month (while automatically solving 50% of your volume using AI) |

So, **Open is 12 times cheaper than any alternative, and on top of that, we free up 50% of your human agents**.
