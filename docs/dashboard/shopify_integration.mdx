The Shopify integration **allows your customers to ask the AI Support Agent to do the following**:

- **Create order returns** and approve them
- **Issue refunds** on demand for:
  - `unfulfilled` items only in the order
  - `returned` items only in the order
  - `returned` and `unfulfilled` items in the order
- **Auto-refund** `returned` items as soon as the return is `closed`
- **Query details** about the store and its products, etc etc

## Prerequisites

- Auto-archival of orders must be disabled, otherwise the archived orders will not be queryable.
  To disable auto-archival, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Order processing** and uncheck **Automatically archive the order**.

- Include a pre-paid shipping label with orders to avoid disputes over return shipping costs.
  Our AI Support Agent automates return requests approval, but does not handle logistics.
- Inspecting returned items and restocking is the responsibility of the store.

## Installation

In your store's dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Apps and sales channels** > **Develop apps**. Or type _\"Build custom apps\"_ in the **Search** bar.
2. Click **Create an app**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. Open) and click **Create app**.
4. Click **Overview** > **Configure admin API Scopes**. Or **Configuration** > **Admin API integration** > **Configure**.
5. Check the following scopes:
   - `write_orders`
   - `read_orders`
   - `write_returns`
   - `read_returns`
   - `read_products`
6. Click **Save**.
7. Go to **API Credentials** > **Access tokens** and click **Install app**. Confirm by clicking **Install** in the confirmation dialog.
8. Now, you'll see the **Admin API access token** section. Click **Reveal token once** to reveal the `token` and save it somewhere safe.
   If you lose the `token` you'll need to **Uninstall app** then **Install** again.
9. Copy your `Shopify domain`, which is the domain of your store (e.g. example.myshopify.com).
   This can be found in the top left corner of the **Settings** section.
10. Go to your **Open** account, then navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Connect with Shopify**.
    Input your `Shopify domain` and your `token`, configure your settings and click **Save**.

## Configuration

### `returnsThresholdDays`

Number of days since order creation. Orders older than the window cannot be returned.

### `autoRefundAfterReturns`

Whether to issue refunds automatically for the returned items once the return is closed.

## How it works

### Returns

- When a customer requests a return, the AI Support Agent will require the customer to provide the `orderNumber`, `email` and `returnReason`.
  - The `email` is used for validation (compared against the `email` associated with the order).
- All `fulfilled` items will be included in the return. Partial returns (or exchanges) are not supported yet.
- Orders older than the `returnsThresholdDays` cannot be returned.
- Valid return requests will be approved automatically by the AI Support Agent.
- Notifications are enabled by default.

### Refunds

- Refunds will be processed through the same **gateway** used for the original payment.
- When a customer returns items of an order and the store receives the items and closes the return,
  if the `autoRefundAfterReturns` setting is enabled, the AI Support Agent will automatically issue refunds for the returned items only.
- If a customer requests a refund, the AI Support Agent will prompt the customer to provide the `orderNumber`, `email` and `refundTarget`.
  - The `email` is used for validation (compared against the `email` associated with the order).
  - The `refundTarget` can be either `returned` or `unfulfilled` or both.
- Notifications are enabled by default.
