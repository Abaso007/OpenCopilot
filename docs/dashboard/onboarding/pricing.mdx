## Pricing Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple and transparent">
    We believe in straightforward pricing. One base fee, and you only pay for successful AI resolutions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full access to all features">
    No feature restrictions or hidden paywalls. Every subscription includes access to all current and future features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pay for value">
    You only pay when our AI successfully resolves support tickets - if we don't deliver value, you don't pay.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unlimited human agents">
    No per-seat pricing. Add as many support agents as you need without additional costs.
  </Accordion>

### Base Subscription
- **$250 USD per month**
- Includes:
  - Unlimited human agents

## How We Define Resolutions

### Successful Resolution Criteria
A ticket is considered successfully resolved when either:
1. The customer explicitly confirms their issue is resolved
2. The conversation naturally concludes with no further questions for 24 hours

### Resolution Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Direct Confirmation">
    - AI: "Is your issue resolved?"
    - Customer: "Yes, thank you!"
    - Result: Marked as resolved, $0.30 charged
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example 2: Natural Conclusion">
    - AI provides solution
    - Customer doesn't respond further
    - After 24 hours: Marked as resolved, $0.30 charged
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example 3: Handoff to Human">
    - AI cannot fully resolve issue
    - Conversation handed to human agent
    - Result: No charge for AI resolution
  </Accordion>
