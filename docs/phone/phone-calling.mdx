## Quick Start

Create your first AI phone agent in the dashboard and start automating your customer support.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Open">
    You can log in to Open using your email and password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the AI phone calling product">
    It is available in the top navigation bar (The App Switcher).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buy a phone number">
    To use AI phone calling, you need to buy a phone number. You can buy a phone number from the dashboard, or you can use the API to buy a phone number. By default, phone numbers will be bought from the US number pool. Email us at [mo@open.cx](mailto:mo@open.cx) if you want to buy a phone number from a different country.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your phone agent">
    Click on the phone number you just bought and configure your phone agent (such as name, initial message, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Concepts and Terminology

Some key concepts and terminology you need to know when using AI phone calling:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the base prompt?">
    The base prompt is the initial message that will be sent to the AI agent when it is first created. It is used to set the tone and provide a welcome message for the agent.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the initial message?">
    This is the message that the AI will first say to the customer, something like "Hello, how can I help you today?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the supported languages?">
    We support English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Russian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Turkish, and Chinese.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much is the latency?">
    The latency is the time it takes for the AI to respond to a customer's message. It depends on the voice and the language used. The latency can be as low as 500ms or as high as 3000ms.
