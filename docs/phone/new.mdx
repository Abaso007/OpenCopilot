Open can also do phone support with:

- **Extra realistc AI voice** that can understand and respond to your customer's questions on the phone.
- **It can take actions** using the actions feature ([learn more](/taking-action))
- The phone conversation **will be recoreded and transcribed into text** and will show up in the Open inbox.
- The **AI can transfer the conversation to a human agent** if the customer is not satisfied with the response.

### Buying a phone number:

To get started with phone support, you can buy a phone number from the dashboard, it will generate a US phone number for you.

from there you can chnage the AI base prompt to be more relevant to your business and the phone support will be more effective.


### Changing the base prompt:

You can change the base prompt to be more relevant to your business and the phone support will be more effective, in general keep in mind the following:

- The base prompt should be short and concise (Remember that the conversation will be on the phone)
- Avoid using complex terms and try to keep it simple.
- Try to give the AI a clear understanding of what you want it to do (by providing action, knowledge base, and other information)

### Handing off to a human agent:

If the customer is not satisfied with the response, the AI can transfer the conversation to a human agent, this is called handing off to a human agent.
